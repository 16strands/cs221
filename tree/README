Welcome to my Tree stuff!

Tree.cpp has some cool functions:

- create_tree makes some space in memory for a tree leaf by simply creating a tree from whatever is inputed and returning a pointer to that tree.

- destroy_tree deletes the tree by recursively deleting from the furthest leaves to the root node.

- path_to uses the helper function keyHere to recursively find out which trees and subtrees hold the key of interest. It crashes if the key is not in the tree.

- node_at just loops through any string and navigates through the inputed tree based on whether the char is an "L" or "R"

To build a tree:
- Building from the bottom up is the easiest thing
- create at least one node using create_tree that has inputs of null pointers for left and right
- Then build towards the root by using previously made nodes as left and right inputs in create_tree

Once your tree is constructed you can run path_to and node_at on it. Don't forget to destroy_tree when youre done
